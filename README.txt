How does the code works in this project?

The Enhanced Canny Edge Detector for Image Segmentation is an advanced MATLAB function designed to segment images with high precision. Leveraging the foundational principles of the Edge Canny Detector by John F. Canny, this function introduces novel modifications for superior performance. It employs a Gaussian filter for noise reduction, computes intensity gradients to highlight potential edges, and utilizes gradient magnitude thresholding to focus on strong edge features. Unique to this implementation are Non-Maximum Suppression and the "Roberts" operator for edge thinning and directionality, deviating from the classic approach to deliver refined segmentation results. This method is ideal for applications requiring accurate edge detection and segmentation, from medical imaging to object recognition in complex scenes.
